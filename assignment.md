# r1-case-studies

## Overview
The purpose of this assignment is to use case studies to understand and assess how researchers map from abstract concepts to the data structures necessary for analysis. These papers are **short, but dense**. You will be responsible for understanding the details of their procedures, but _do not necessarily_ need to understand the statistical methods employed. In order to appropriately answer the questions below, you will likely need to **read the papers multiple times**. I suggest that you skim each paper to get a broad understanding, then **re-read the paper** to understand the details. Attempting to answer the questions below without reading the entire paper will both be less accurate and take more time.

## Detecting influenza epidemics using search engine query data

1. What is the purpose of this research? _(1 paragraph, 3 points)_

2. What are the current (i.e., alternative) approaches to measuring detecting influenza outbreaks, and what are their limitations? _(1 paragraph, 3 points)_

3. The title of the paper introduces two broad concepts: _influenza epidemics_ and _search engine queries_. In order to assess the relationship between these two concepts, each one needs to be mapped to a **data structure**. For each concept, answer the following questions: _(~2 paragraphs, 10 points)_

    a. What were the sources of data? Once the data is formatted for analysis, what does a single observation in the (prepared) data represent (think about the _unit of analysis_)? _(5 points)_

    b. What concerns do you have about the relationship between the abstract concepts and the data used to represent them in the analysis? Do you feel as if the data adequately captures the concepts? Why/why not? _(5 points)_

4. In the primary statistical analysis, what are the **null and alternate hypothesis**? _(1 paragraph, 4 points)_

5. Both variables used in the study had to be _normalized_ at some point in the analytical process. What does _normalization_ involve, and why was it important for this study? _(1 paragraph, 3 points)_

6. No data was provided outside the flu season -- do you think this has any implication for the analysis? Why / why not? _(1 paragraph, 4 points)_

7. The paper described a method for assessing (validating) their statistical model. What did they do, and what were the results? _(1 paragraph, 5 points)_.

8. Identify a topic/skill in the paper that interests you (statistical method, etc.). Then, do a bit of research, and report back. Feel free to show a sample demonstration of this method in a language of your choice, or a layman's interpretation of what they method does _(~2 paragraphs, 8 points)_.

9. In layman's terms, what does the linear regression attempt to measure? _(1 paragraph, 4 points)_

10. Overall, what is your impression of this study? Do you believe the insights are reliable and can be applied in real world situations? _(1 paragraph, 4 points)_


## Experimental evidence of mass-scale emotional contagion through social networks

1. What is the purpose of this research? _(1 paragraph, 3 points)_

2. Unlike the above study, which was _observational_, this study conducted an _experiment_. Describe, in detail, how the experiment was conducted. Be sure to mention **who** was included in the study, **when** it was conducted, and **how** individuals in the study were _experimented upon_. _(2 paragraphs, 6 points)_

3. In order to conduct this study, the researchers had to map from the concepts of emotional positivity/negativity to a dataset. How were these concepts captured in the data, and what are some of the limitations of this approach? _(1 paragraph, 5 points)_

4. Using at least one outside reference, identify and describe an alternative approach for determining the emotional content of a piece of text. _(1 paragraph, 4 points)_

5. The statistical analyses presented in the paper report _statistical significance_ with a p-value < .05 (more on this later in the course). However, are their observations _practically significant_ (i.e. meaningful)? How do the authors defend the claim that their observations are socially consequential? _(1 paragraph, 4 points)_

6. Identify a topic/skill in the paper that interests you (statistical method, etc.). Then, do a bit of research, and report back. Feel free to show a sample demonstration of this method in a language of your choice, or a layman's interpretation of what they method does. _(~2 paragraphs, 8 points)_

7. What are some of the ethical concerns of conducting such a study? _(1 paragraph, 4 points)_

8. Like many studies that seek to measure the effect in an experiment, this study used a _control group_. Describe how the control group was used in this study, and state why was it important to include it. _(1 paragraph, 4 points)_

9. The presumed _causal pathway_ of this study is that seeing an emotional post _leads to_ a changed emotional state _resulting in_ changes in social media behavior. What are **alternative causal pathways** that explain the relationship between the presumed cause (change in content) and resulting behavior (change in posting). _(1 paragraph, 5 points)_

10. The study describes a linear regression as it's primary assessment. Answer the following questions regarding the analysis: _(2 paragraphs, 4 points)_

    a. What was the unit of analysis (i.e., what would each row of data represent)? _(2 points)_

    b. Explain (intuitively) what this analysis is attempting to measure. _(2 points)_

11. Overall, what is your impression of this study? Do you believe the insights are reliable and can be applied in real world situations? _(1 paragraph, 5 points)_
